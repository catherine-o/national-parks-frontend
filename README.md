## General info
En Route is a single page application where users can save National Parks and Monuments to a Bucketlist (places where they'd like to go) or a Memoir (places where they have been). Users have the opportunity to filter parks by state, learn more about each park, as well as view a Google Map of the park's general location.

const renderCards = (state) => {
  const filteredParks = parks.filter(park => {

      return park
    }
  })
  return filterParks(filteredParks)
 }
